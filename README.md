# Data-Science-Assignment_Linear-Regression-in-Python
In this assignment, I have implemented Linear Regression in Python with one variable and with multiple variables.

In part 1 of the assignment, I have implemented a linear regression model using single variable to find the relationship between the profit of a bakery and the population of the city it is opened in.

In the second part, I have implemented linear regression to determine the price of houses given a set of features. 

The detailed problem statement can be found in "Assignment_1.docx" in this repository.

part1.py contains the code for the first part of the assignment

The second part is in two files, featureNormalize.py and multivariateLinearRegression.py

The file normalized_features.txt is the file that was generated to write normalized features. This file is generated by featureNormalize.py and used by multivariateLinearRegression.py.

ex1data1.txt is the data set for the first part. Details related to the data set can be found in "Assignment_1.docx"

ex1data2.txt is the data set for the second part. Details related to the data set can be found in "Assignment_1.docx"

The code was written and tested in Python 3.6.4
