# Data-Science-Assignment_Linear-Regression-in-Python
In this assignment, I have implemented Linear Regression in Python with one variable and with multiple variables.

In part 1 of the assignment, I have implemented a linear regression model using single variable to find the relationship between the profit of a bakery and the population of the city it is opened in.

In the second part, I have implemented linear regression to determine the price of houses given a set of features. 

The detailed problem statement can be found in "Assignment_1.docx" in this repository.
